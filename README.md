Very basic script to run Bidirectional Best Hitn (BBH) orthologs identification method on a set of genomes.

This code is meant to be run on NCBI formatted genomes using 1. one (or a set) of querie(s) in a fasta-formatted file, 2. A target genome (the one you got your queries from) and 3. A set of target genomes (those you want to scan for the presence of the queries)
